    <h1>Text to Speech Example</h1>
    <p class="para">This classic fable (story) is about a very slow tortoise (turtle) and a speedy hare (rabbit). The
        tortoise challenges
        the hare to a race. The hare laughs at the idea that a tortoise could run faster than him, but the race ends
        with a
        surprising result.

        Have you ever heard the English expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”? This story is the basis for that
        common
        phrase. You can read it for free, along with a number of other stories in this list!</p>
